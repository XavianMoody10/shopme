# shopme
Shopme is a ecommerce demo website made with RaectJS

## Why Make this project
I embarked on the creation of the ReactJS project, "ShopMe," with a dual purpose in mind. Firstly, the inception of this ecommerce website stemmed from a personal challenge I set out to conquer, aiming to push the boundaries of my development skills. Through ShopMe, I sought to not only showcase my proficiency in ReactJS but also to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of integrating APIs into web projects effectively. By seamlessly incorporating an API into ShopMe, I aimed to illustrate how it can be leveraged to enhance the user experience and streamline operations within an ecommerce platform, thus encapsulating the essence of modern web development practices.

## Link to Design
There's no design. I built this on the go. While building this project, I was more focused onn the functionality than the style.

## Demo
This is the link to the demo. Please give as much feedback as you can. As a beginner, I really want to get better as a coder and earn my first developer job.
