# shopme
Shopme is a ecommerce demo website made with ReactJS

## Why Make this project
I embarked on the creation of the ReactJS project, "ShopMe," with a dual purpose in mind. Firstly, the inception of this ecommerce website stemmed from a personal challenge I set out to conquer, aiming to push the boundaries of my development skills. Through ShopMe, I sought to not only showcase my proficiency in ReactJS but also to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of integrating APIs into web projects effectively. By seamlessly incorporating an API into ShopMe, I aimed to illustrate how it can be leveraged to enhance the user experience and streamline operations within an ecommerce platform, thus encapsulating the essence of modern web development practices.

## Link to Design
There's no design. While building this project, I was more focused on the functionality than the style.

## Side Note
The incomplete integration of Stripe into my website stems from several challenges encountered during the implementation process. While Stripe is renowned for its robust payment processing capabilities, navigating its documentation proved to be less straightforward than anticipated. Crucial information necessary for seamless integration seemed to be missing from the documentation, necessitating extensive searches across the website for viable solutions. Although I successfully rendered the necessary form elements on the page, executing payments requires a backend server, typically facilitated through platforms like Node.js. However, my proficiency in utilizing Node.js for backend operations is still in its developmental stages, presenting a significant hurdle in achieving full integration of Stripe's payment functionalities. As I continue to expand my skill set, bridging this gap remains a priority, ensuring a seamless and secure payment experience for users on my ecommerce platform.
